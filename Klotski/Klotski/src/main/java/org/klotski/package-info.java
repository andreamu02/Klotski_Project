/**
 * Package that contains all the java files for klotski game
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * Klotski is a simple puzzle game implemented in Java.
 * The goal is to release the large 2x2 tile from the board
 * through the opening centered at the bottom of the board. To
 * select a piece, click on it. Then it can be moved in any
 * direction with the WASD keys or the arrow buttons.
 * You can also move pieces by dragging them across the
 * board with the mouse.
 * Only the large 2x2 tile can leave the board, so you have to
 * move the right pieces to complete the puzzle in the fewest moves.
