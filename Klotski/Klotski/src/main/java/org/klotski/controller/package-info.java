/**
 * This package contains Controller classes, that are useful to do few but optimized things<br>
 * These classes are designed to work as a link between {@link org.klotski.graphics.Window Window} and {@link org.klotski.coding Coding} classes.<br>
 * To use this package at the best possible, is it preferable to call these classes and relative function inline.<br>
 * In fact, every class has one or more methods that can be called to do a specific action.
